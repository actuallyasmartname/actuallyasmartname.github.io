    <h2>Lossless audio ripping from YouTube</h2>
    <h3><b>Yes, it's actually possible. Here's how to do it.</b></h3>
    <p>(obvious note) This is only possible on videos that had... lossless audio uploaded to them. All of my non videogame music rips have lossless, so they work on them.</p>
    <p>Note #2: Yes, YouTube caps audio quality at a certain point so you won't have a true lossless original but it's still acceptable.</p>
    <p>1. Get a good downloader. In my opinion, <a href="https://cobalt.tools">cobalt.tools</a> is the best out there for easy access.</p>
    <p>2. Download in the highest quality possible. 4K+ should use AV1, but that's not widely supported on all videos so use VP9 instead.</p>
    <p>3. Use a converter to convert it to a FLAC file. The higher the quality, the higher the bitrate (and size).</p>
    <p>4. Profit</p>
