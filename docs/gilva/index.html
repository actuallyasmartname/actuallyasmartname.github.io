    <h2>Gilva Dot Sunner's Scrumdiddlydumptious Ripping Guide</h2>
    <p>Yo, I suck at HTML and CSS so bear with me this page will look very bad!!!</p>
    <h3><b>Wii</b></h3>
    <p>I strongly recommend GameGuy444's ripping tools, there is full documentation on <a href="https://ffshrine.org/archive/t-69234.html">this</a> forum post.</p>
    <p>100% update all the tools in here!!! especially VGMStream as inaccurate rips are possible</p>
    <p>One thing that should be noted is that WiiScrubber only allows you to extract one BRSTM file at once, to combat this extract the entire DATA partition and separate the BRSTM files</p>
