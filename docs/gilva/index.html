    <h2>Gilva Dot Sunner's Scrumdiddlydumptious Ripping Guide</h2>
    <p>Yo, I suck at HTML and CSS so bear with me this page will look very bad!!! also this is for just ripping and stuff and no MIDIs!!! for MIDIs go to <a href="https://highquality.rip/ripguide/">here!</a></p>
    <h3><b>Wii</b></h3>
    <p>I strongly recommend GameGuy444's ripping tools, there is full documentation on <a href="https://ffshrine.org/archive/t-69234.html">this</a> forum post.</p>
    <p>If you have a WBFS file use the tool <a href="https://wbfstoiso.com">WBFSToISO</a> to convert it to a Wii Disc (not ISO 9960 or compact ISO!)<p>
    <p>100% update all the tools in here!!! especially VGMStream as inaccurate rips are possible</p>
    <p>The latest version of VGMStream can be downloaded from <a href="https://vgmstream.org/">here</a> and wwPacker 1.84 (final version of wwPacker) can be downloaded <a href="https://gbatemp.net/download/wwpacker.36649/history">here.</a> All other programs are up to date to my knowledge.</p>
    <p>One last thing, WiiScrubber only allows you to extract one BRSTM or whatever file at once, to combat this extract the entire DATA partition and separate the BRSTM/whatever files</p>
    <h3><b>Nintendo DS</b></h3>
    <p>You can just put the ROM in <a href="https://github.com/vgmtrans/vgmtrans">VGMTrans</a> and it should work fine. Just make sure to check accuracy, then right click on the music file you want to export under Detected Music Files (you should see Export To WAVE or something). Sometimes games use streamed audio and I don't think that's rippable sadly</p>
    <p>To download VGMTrans, scroll down to the table in README.md and click the link under Build Available (sorry FreeBSD!) then click the latest commit and scroll down to Artifacts then click on the build w/ your OS name. If it isn't there check the commits until you find it.</p>
    <p>Note that these builds might be unstable and music might sound slightly off! Just be aware of this plz ty!!!!</p>
    <h3><b>Game Boy/Game Boy Color</b></h3>
    <p>Obtain a .GBS file of the game music you want to rip (or do it yourself but most games already have .GBS files ripped of them). You can get GBS files from <a href="https://zophar.net">Zophar's Domain</a> or from <a href="https://gbs.joshw.info/">joshw</a>'s website.</p>
    <p>Once your have your .GBS, find a program that plays them (I recommend <a href="https://www.foobar2000.org/download">Foobar2000</a>). There should be a way to extract them from there. Note that you have to add fade-outs to looping music manually most of the time.</p>
