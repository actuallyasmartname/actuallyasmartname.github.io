    <h2>Gilva Dot Sunner's Scrumdiddlydumptious Ripping Guide</h2>
    <p>Yo, I suck at HTML and CSS so bear with me this page will look very bad!!! also this is for just ripping and stuff and no MIDIs!!! for MIDIs go to <a href="https://highquality.rip/ripguide/">here!</a></p>
    <h3><b>Wii</b></h3>
    <p>I strongly recommend GameGuy444's ripping tools. However they have gone unmaintained so I decided to do it myself. Download it from <a href="https://mega.nz/folder/7zJCnTJJ#H9V6s_bbbtqacRYjIjcgRg">here</a> and see the file "wii2wavV2.txt" for docs.</p>
    <h3><b>Nintendo DS</b></h3>
    <p>You can just put the ROM in <a href="https://github.com/vgmtrans/vgmtrans">VGMTrans</a> and it should work fine. Just make sure to check accuracy, then right click on the music file you want to export under Detected Music Files (you should see Export To WAVE or something).</p>
    <p>To download VGMTrans, scroll down to the table in README.md and click the link under Build Available (sorry FreeBSD!) then click the latest commit and scroll down to Artifacts then click on the build w/ your OS name (or be a cool kid and compile it from source). If it isn't there check the commits until you find it.</p>
    <p>Note that these builds might be unstable and music might sound slightly off! Just be aware of this plz ty!!!!</p>
    <h3><b>Game Boy/Game Boy Color</b></h3>
    <p>Obtain a .GBS file of the game music you want to rip (or do it yourself but most games already have .GBS files ripped of them). You can get GBS files from <a href="https://www.zophar.net/music/gameboy-gbs">Zophar's Domain</a> or from <a href="https://gbs.joshw.info/">joshw</a>'s website.</p>
    <p>Once your have your .GBS, find a program that plays them (I recommend <a href="https://www.foobar2000.org/download">Foobar2000</a> with plugins). There should be a way to extract them from there. Note that you have to add fade-outs to looping music manually most of the time.</p>
    <h3><b>Super NES/Super Famicom</b></h3>
    <p>Obtain a .SPC file, or rip these by yourself. You can get SPC files from <a href="https://www.zophar.net/music/nintendo-snes-spc">Zophar's Domain</a> or from <a href="https://spc.joshw.info/">joshw</a>'s website.</p>
    <p>Once you have your .SPC, get DGRFactory's <a href="https://github.com/dgrfactory/spcplay">SPCPlay</a> utility, and open the file from there. For the highest quality, set Bit to 32-bit (float) and interpolation to Sinc Function. To export as .WAV, click "SAVE" and select .wav from File Type in Explorer.</p>
    <h3><b>Useful stuff</b></h3>
    <p>For New Super Mario Bros. Wii, the filesystem for the soundfiles can be found <a href="https://horizon.miraheze.org/wiki/Filesystem/sound/stream">here</a>.</p>
