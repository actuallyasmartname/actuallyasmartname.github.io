    <h2>Gilva Dot Sunner's Scrumdiddlydumptious Ripping Guide</h2>
    <p>Yo, I suck at HTML and CSS so bear with me this page will look very bad!!!</p>
    <h3><b>Wii</b></h3>
    <p>I strongly recommend GameGuy444's ripping tools, there is full documentation on <a href="https://ffshrine.org/archive/t-69234.html">this</a> forum post.</p>
    <p>If you have a WBFS file use the tool <a href="https://wbfstoiso.com">WBFSToISO</a> to convert it to a Wii Disc (not ISO 9960 or compact ISO!)<p>
    <p>100% update all the tools in here!!! especially VGMStream as inaccurate rips are possible</p>
    <p>The latest version of VGMStream can be downloaded from <a href="https://vgmstream.org/">here</a> and wwPacker 1.84 (final version of wwPacker) can be downloaded <a href="https://gbatemp.net/download/wwpacker.36649/history">here.</a> All other programs are up to date to my knowledge.</p>
    <p>One last thing, WiiScrubber only allows you to extract one BRSTM or whatever file at once, to combat this extract the entire DATA partition and separate the BRSTM/whatever files</p>
